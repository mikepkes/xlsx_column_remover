# To Use:
* Put all source files in one directory.  Files can be mixed with others and nested, but the script needs a single directory to choose.
* Create an output directory for the results to be placed in.
* Right-click on script and choose "Run with Powershell"
* The first dialog will ask you for a folder to select as the source.
* The second dialog will ask you for a folder to select as the output.
* The last dialog will ask for the column letters to be specified.  If removing multiple columns, use commas (with no other spaces) to separate them.
